%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MATH MACROS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% basic settings for math environment
\allowdisplaybreaks[1]                  % page break for long equations
\numberwithin{equation}{chapter}        % eqn no with chapter label
\setcounter{MaxMatrixCols}{20}          % no of maximum columns in matrix

%% custom math macros
\newcommand{\dC}{$^{\circ}$C}           % degree celsius symbol
\newcommand{\vect}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}      % boldface for vectors and tensors
\DeclareMathOperator{\T}{{\top}}        % transpose of a matrix/ tensor
\DeclareMathOperator{\tr}{tr}           % trace of a matrix
\DeclareMathOperator{\divg}{div}        % divergence of vector and tensor
\DeclareMathOperator{\grad}{grad}       % gradient of vector and tensor
\DeclareMathOperator{\curl}{curl}       % curl of vector and tensor

%% theorem-style remark environment (custom)
\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{remark}{Remark}
\counterwithin{remark}{chapter}
